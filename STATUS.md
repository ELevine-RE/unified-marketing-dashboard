- [x] Implement basic test script to verify Google Ads API access
- [x] Document setup steps in README

### 2. Authentication & Connection
- [x] **Run OAuth flow to obtain refresh token** ✅ COMPLETED
  - Successfully obtained refresh token from Google OAuth
  - Configured OAuth credentials properly
  - Authentication working correctly

- [x] **Populate .env and run connection test** ✅ COMPLETED
  - Populated .env file with all required credentials
  - Successfully tested Google Ads API connection
  - Manager account authentication working
  - Can list accessible customers

### 3. Core System Development

## 🎯 Current System Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Authentication**: Fully functional OAuth 2.0 flow
- **API Connection**: Successfully connecting to Google Ads API
- **Manager Account Access**: Can access manager account (5426234549)
- **Customer Discovery**: Can list accessible customers
- **Code Structure**: Complete AI-powered management system

### ⚠️ Current Limitation
- **Developer Token Access Level**: Only has Test Account access
- **Live Account Access**: Cannot access live campaign data (requires Basic/Standard access)
- **Campaign Verification**: Cannot verify "L.R - PMax - General" campaign (not in test accounts)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Required Action
1. **Apply for Basic/Standard Access** at [Google Ads API Center](https://ads.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. **Wait for Approval** (typically 1-2 business days)
3. **Test Live Access** once approved

### Once Approved
- Run `python check_page_feed_simple.py` to verify campaign
- Run `python pmax_campaign_creator.py` to create real campaigns
- Use `python examples/quick_analysis.py` for live performance analysis
