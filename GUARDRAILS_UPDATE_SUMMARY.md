# Guardrails Update Summary

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

The current budget and tCPA guardrails were too restrictive for the competitive real estate market:

- **Maximum daily budget**: $100 (too low for luxury/commercial real estate)
- **Maximum Target CPA**: $200 (too low for high-value lead acquisition)
- **Configuration**: Hardcoded in `guardrails.py` making future adjustments difficult

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Updated Budget and tCPA Limits**

**Budget Limits:**
- **Maximum daily budget**: $100 → **$250** (+150%)
- **Minimum daily budget**: $30 (unchanged)
- **Adjustment percentages**: ±20-30% (unchanged)
- **Frequency**: Once per week (unchanged)

**Target CPA Limits:**
- **Maximum tCPA**: $200 → **$350** (+75%)
- **Minimum tCPA**: $80 (unchanged)
- **Adjustment percentages**: ±10-15% (unchanged)
- **Frequency**: Once every 2 weeks (unchanged)
- **Minimum conversions**: 30 (unchanged)

### **2. Refactored Configuration Management**

**Created `config/guardrails_config.yaml`:**
- Centralized configuration file for all guardrail settings
- Easy to modify without code changes
- YAML format for readability
- Market-specific settings included

**Updated `ads/guardrails.py`:**
- Added YAML configuration loading
- Fallback to default config if file not found
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Added configuration validation

### **3. Updated Documentation**

**Updated `README.md`:**
- Changed budget limits: $100 → $250
- Changed tCPA limits: $200 → $350
- Updated acceptance criteria

## 🏠 **Real Estate Market Impact**

### **Before (Restrictive Limits):**
- **Luxury Property Campaign**: $80 → $180 budget (❌ Blocked by $100 limit)
- **Commercial Property Campaign**: $120 → $220 budget (❌ Blocked by $100 limit)
- **High-Value tCPA**: $120 → $280 tCPA (❌ Blocked by $200 limit)

### **After (Competitive Limits):**
- **Luxury Property Campaign**: $80 → $180 budget (✅ Allowed under $250 limit)
- **Commercial Property Campaign**: $120 → $220 budget (✅ Allowed under $250 limit)
- **High-Value tCPA**: $120 → $280 tCPA (✅ Allowed under $350 limit)

### **Key Benefits:**

- **ROI Optimization**: Better optimization for high-value transactions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Configuration File Structure:**
```yaml

```

### **Code Changes:**
- **Added YAML import** to `guardrails.py`
